          <h2>Cloud native artificial intelligence and artificial
            life</h2>
          <aside class='notes'>This is what I said I was going to talk
    about: From computer science and engineering to AI: cloud native artificial intelligence and artificial life.

            The main theme of this lesson is how cloud computing is changing the paradigm of software development to a codesign of software and systems (devops) and also to several other trends, like serverless computing, concurrency and software as a system. This has led to the mainstreaming of artificial intelligence (as a service), but also to the creation of systems whose very nature is stochastic, leading to version of traditional metaheuristics that can't rely on static, never-changing deployments. We will explain in this lesson how to tap these resources, and how to redesign traditional metaheuristics, specially evolutionary algorithms, to take advantage of them.</aside>

        shows the "commoditization" of AI, but also the introduction
        of computing environments that are totally different from your
        average desktop, monolytic environments. You need to know
            stuff.</aside>
